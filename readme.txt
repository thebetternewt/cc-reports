Installing scripts:

Must add “cc-reports” directory containing script “cc-report.rb” inside a directory on C: called “Ruby Scripts”. These directories must be setup manually.

Running the CC Report process:

1.	Download Converge Batch report, iModules Export report, and iModules Designation report.
2.	Open Excel (new spreadsheet).
3.	Under “Gift Admin” tab. Click |1| Merge, and select files as prompted.
4.	When new spreadsheet appears, click |2| Format.

Windows users will need to install ruby and ruby interpreter. They can also create a shortcut for running the script within the folder. See included documentation (.docx/.PDF).

All outputted final reports will appear in the "reports directory"
